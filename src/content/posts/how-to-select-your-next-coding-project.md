For those of you who prefer to watch a video I made on my channel regarding this subject:

<iframe class="mx-auto" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ACMsDQgZYCc" title="How I Became A Web Developer By Replacing Video Games With Coding" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

It's common for us programmers to look for "the best" project we can make using our knowledge. Usually, we become overwhelmed by all the different options available, wasting hours in search of "the best" project
and when we find one we ditch it after a week mostly because we don't enjoy working on it.

While it's perfectly fine to look for inspiration, once you have a project in mind and it's something you either have a passion for or simply enjoy, just do it! I can personally tell you that when I started web development and looked for a project to build using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I built a website for a video game called Maplestory. To this day, it remains one of the most enjoyable projects I have made.

It doesn't matter that it's not considered "the best" project or something that many people will care about. It's a game I grew up with, and as a result, I had a lot of fun with it because it's a subject I genuinely cared about. Don't get me wrong; if you believe that creating a certain project will help you secure a desired job, by all means, pursue that project. However, when you're seeking a random project to work on, in your free time, choose something you are passionate about, and once you find one, **JUST DO IT!!**
