#### What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

#### Supervised Learning

In supervised learning, we are given a data set and already **know** what our correct output should look like, having the idea that there is a relationship between the input and the output.

In this type of learning, problems can be categorized into "regression" and "classification" problems.

- In a regression problem, we are trying to predict results within a continuous output. For example, predicting the price of a house based on its size.

- In a classification problem, we are trying to predict results in a discrete output. For example, Given a patient with a tumor, we have to predict whether the tumor is malignant or benign.

#### Unsupervised Learning

In unsupervised learning, we are given a data set, and we **don't know** what our correct output should look like. Instead of having labeled examples to learn from, the algorithm explores the data on its own, identifying inherent patterns, relationships, or clusters without explicit guidance.

For example, given a large collection of articles, using this type of learning you can analyze the text and automatically group similar articles together, revealing patterns or themes without any predefined labels.
