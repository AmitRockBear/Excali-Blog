Hey there! I'm Amit Rockach, and I'm delighted to welcome you to my blog. From the earliest days, I've been captivated by computers and video games, but it was during my high school years that my passion for programming truly ignited.

In my free time, I explored the field of programming, delving into various languages and different fields. I briefly tried my hand at Machine Learning but soon realized I lack the academic math skills to really get the hang of it. That's when I decided to focus on another field I found interest in, Web Development.

### A Journey in Web Development

Web Development quickly became my niche, fighting my desires to play Maplestory and Overwatch, I embarked on a journey of learning new programming languages, exploring fresh concepts, and diving into various frameworks. Exploring the internet, I learned how to design and create my own websites using technologies like React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. However, I soon realized that to make my sites more engaging, I needed to incorporate server-side development. This led to me becoming proficient in deploying servers using Node.js and managing databases with MongoDB and SQL.

Right after this exciting phase, I showcased my skills in the web development field and with a lot of luck, I successfully enlisted in the IDF, where I served as a Full Stack Developer for three years. This experience not only broadened my technical expertise but also instilled discipline, teamwork, and problem-solving skills that I carry with me to this day.

### Academic Pursuits

In my final year in the IDF, I made the decision to broaden my academic horizons by pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I took the first step by enrolling in two courses at The Open University before the official start of the academic year. Subsequently, I joined Tel Aviv University, and recently finished my first year of studies in Computer Science.

### Curiosity and Creation

In my free time, I persist in exploring new frameworks (as if there aren't already plenty of them), learning new programming languages, and explore new fields. In fact, the inspiration for this blog came to life after learning the Astro framework.

### Let's clear the elephant in the room: ExcaliBear

This name is a playful spin on the iconic Excalibur, flavored with my affection for bears as a symbol. Interestingly, it wasn't my idea; my brother actually suggested it as a gaming nickname.

### Join the Journey

Whether you're a fellow developer seeking knowledge, a potential collaborator, or simply share an enthusiasm for all things tech, you're more than welcome here.

Feel free to connect with me, explore my projects, and dive into the world of ExcaliBear.
